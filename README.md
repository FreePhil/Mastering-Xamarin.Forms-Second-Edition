# Mastering Xamarin.Forms - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Xamarin.Forms - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-xamarinforms-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788290265), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Xamarin released the Xamarin.Forms toolkit in the summer of 2014, and it has since become
a very popular framework for .NET mobile app developers. On the surface, Xamarin.Forms
is a user interface toolkit focused on abstracting the platform-specific UI APIs of iOS,
Android, and Windows into a single easy-to-use set of APIs. In addition, Xamarin.Forms
also provides the common components of a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) framework,
making it extremely easy and intuitive to bind data to a user interface.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
public abstract class BaseViewModel
{
 protected BaseViewModel ()
 { }
}
```

To get the most out of this book, you should have a working knowledge of the Xamarin
platform and Xamarin.Forms toolkit as well as experience with .NET.
In order to follow along with the code throughout this book, you will need to have Visual
Studio and Xamarin installed on your Windows or Mac machine. Although the examples
throughout this book are shown in Visual Studio for Mac, everything shown can also be
done in Visual Studio for Windows. If you are using a Windows machine, you will need a
Mac running Xamarin on your network to serve as a build host to build and deploy iOS
apps. For details on setting up a Mac build host or any other requirements for setting up a
Xamarin development environment, visit docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin.
In Chapter 6, API Data Access, you will need a Microsoft Azure account in order to follow
along with the examples to create a basic API using an Azure App Service.
Throughout this book, there are several tools and libraries used, which are obtained from
NuGet via the Visual Studio package manager.
